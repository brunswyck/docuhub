what is defi
------------
definition
^^^^^^^^^^
* Decentralized finance—DeFi—refers to the shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by the Ethereum blockchain.

* From stablecoins, to lending and borrowing, to prediction markets, margin trading, payments, insurance, gaming, and NFT marketplaces, the DeFi ecosystem now represents an expansive network of integrated protocols and financial instruments worth more than $70 billion USD

- open to everyone
- no 3rd parties

smart contracts
---------------

    :data-background-size: zoom

- A smart contract is a self-executing contract with terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements lives on a distributed, decentralized blockchain. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible

- Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism

- code is law?

stablecoins

A stablecoin is a form of cryptocurrency that minimizes volatility

- dai (pegged to $ with collateral in crypto)
- usdt (fiat backed)
- usdc (fiat backed)
  commodity backed
- algo stablecoins
  - ampleforth (rebasing)

automated market makers
-----------------------

    :data-background-size: contain


- liquidity pools (replaces orderbooks, incentivized)
- concentrated liquidity uniswap v3
- pools of tokens that are locked in a smart contract. They are used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity and are extensively used by some of the decentralized exchanges a.k.a DEXes

non-custodial
-------------

* non-custodial refers to a service in which the funds or assets aren’t possessed by a platform or third-party

at any point during a transaction or service period
everything occurs through trustless smart contracts:
the complex self-executing series of code that power blockchain networks

this is in contrast to custodial services, which take possession of a user’s funds or assets for safekeeping, management, etc

Non-custodial services are considered the hall-mark and prime example of decentralization and non-reliance to intermediaries. Crypto proponents prefer them over custodial services since the latter incurs more risks

yield farming
