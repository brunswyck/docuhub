DeFi
====
wtf is DeFi?
------------

a movement that is creating a new financial system that is open to everyone (transparancy)  and doesn't require intermediaries like banks (trust)
to achieve this goal, defi relies heavily on cryptography, blockchain & smart contracts

why DeFi
--------

tradfi:

- obfuscating collateral, hidden risk
- banks run on old tech
- still works through batches of transactions that clear overnight
- 
- HFT frontrunning by large institutions with deep pockets
- closed markets are highly standardized, unfit for purpose and tend toward monopolistic structure
- very restricted access (even for analysis)
- venture capitalism
- transparancy anyone?
- shorting & gamestop anyone?
- new crowdloan models and it's promise
- trading sessions

liquidify
---------

wrapped btc
staked dot/ksm

current state of defi
---------------------

pros:

 - ability to invest in crowdloan models

cons:
 - lessons learned in cefi repeating itself
