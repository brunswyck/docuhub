Introductory example - Plotting sin
===================================

This is a general example demonstrating a Matplotlib plot output, embedded
rST, the use of math notation and cross-linking to other examples.

Source files for gallery examples should start with a triple-quoted header
docstring. Anything before the docstring is ignored by Sphinx-Gallery and will
not appear in the rendered output, nor will it be executed. This docstring
requires a rST header, which is used as the title of the example and
to correctly build cross-referencing links.

Mathematical expressions can be included as LaTeX, and will be rendered with
MathJax. To include displayed math notation, use the directive ``.. math::``.
To include inline math notation use the ``:math:`` role. For example, we are
about to plot the following function:

.. math::

    x \rightarrow \sin(x)

Here the function :math:`\sin` is evaluated at each point the variable
:math:`x` is defined. When including LaTeX in a Python string, ensure that you
escape the backslashes or use a :ref:`raw docstring <python:strings>`. You do
not need to do this in text blocks (see below).
